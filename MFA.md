# Multi Factor Athentification

>[!tip]
>MFA is a way to protect your infrastructure by integrating more layers of protection for authentification.
>
>Instead of only having the Windows basic Password authentifiaction, some softwares can add an other layer with a confirmation code or push sent on an other trusted device, that is configurered when the software is installed.
>
>You have also maybe heard about 2FA, or Double Factor Authentification. The two are basically the same system but 2FA is limited to adding an other layer not multiple ones.
>
>These systems can be used on most devices in an infrastructure: Laptops, desktops, servers, VMs, Switches, etc...
>
>But it can also be used to add a layer of protection to website accounts. Your Amazon account has 2FA, as well as you Social media accounts.
